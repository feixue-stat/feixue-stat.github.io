<h2>Tips for graduate students</h2>	
<p>
The goal of advising is to train you into an independent researcher in statistics.
An important part of the training is done in regular weekly meetings. 
The length of each meeting is typically about one hour. 
</p>
<p>
Prior to the meeting, you are expected to 
<li> have spent enough time reading or working on what I suggested, </li>
<li>tried hard to solve any difficulties that appear (e.g. by thinking hard, searching online, reading other sources, working out simple examples, or finding an alternative way, etc.), </li>
<li>clearly summarized your new findings (or what you learned) and any difficult parts worth discussing.</li>

</p>
<p>
During the meeting, I would expect you to explain with clear statements about what you have found or learned.
It is good to bring some very brief notes you have prepared just to remind you what to discuss, but it is usually a bad idea to read and copy from a book or paper.
I will comment on any ideas or arguments you present or ask questions, answer your questions, and suggest ideas or references to deal with any difficulties you run into.
</p>
<p>
After the meeting, I would expect you to write a very brief email to me summarizing what we discussed, which could be helpful for future references.
You may also write up some of our discussions (that you find important) in your own more detailed notes.
